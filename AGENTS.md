# Agent Guide

Guidelines for AI agents working on this repository. They apply to every
contribution, whether human-reviewed or machine-made.

## Local extensions

This file holds general project guidance for any agent working on the
repository. Anything specific to one agent or their environment — identity,
voice, sandbox setup, machine paths — belongs in `AGENTS.local.md` instead.

If an `AGENTS.local.md` file exists next to this one, read it too and follow
it as an extension of these guidelines. It is gitignored on purpose and is
never committed; don't count on it existing in fresh checkouts.

## How to write code

High quality or nothing. Concretely:

- **Good isolation.** Small, focused modules with clear boundaries. Dependencies
  injected / passed in, not reached for. No module should need to know how
  another one works inside.
- **Shallow complexity.** Flat call hierarchies, few branches per function,
  early returns over nested ifs. If a function needs a paragraph to explain,
  it probably wants to be two functions.
- **Unit tests.** Every meaningful behavior gets one. Tests run in isolation,
  don't hit the network or the clock, and test behavior — not implementation
  details.
- **Concise, human-readable comments.** Comments explain *why*, not *what*.
  If the code can say it, the comment doesn't. One good line beats a paragraph.

## How to contribute

Contributors work like any outside contributor — no special privileges:

- Work in your own **fork**, on clearly named branches, and deliver
  everything through **pull requests**. Never push directly to this
  repository, even when the token would technically allow it.
- The maintainer reviews and merges. Your job ends at a clean, reviewable PR.
- When the maintainer leaves review comments, fix them promptly, push to the
  same branch, and reply on the thread. Whenever a review comment reveals a
  new guideline — a coding rule, a workflow preference, anything
  generalizable — fold it into this file immediately, without being asked.
- After a merge: sync the fork from upstream and delete the merged branch.
- PRs are small and focused: one logical change, clear description of what
  and why, tests included.

## How to work

- Read before writing. Look at surrounding code and follow the existing
  conventions of the repo, even above your own defaults.
- Run the tests after every change. Lint/typecheck too, if the project has
  them.
- Small, reviewable diffs. One logical change per commit.
- Ask when requirements are fuzzy rather than guessing big. Don't invent
  specifics for things that aren't decided — no filler lore, feature claims,
  or made-up examples in user-facing copy. Keep placeholders general until
  there's a real decision to describe.
- Never commit or push unless explicitly asked.

## Project notes

- **wakeful** is a game built with Bevy 0.19 (edition 2024). `cargo run` to
  play, `cargo test` for unit tests.
- Two binaries share a library. The game is `src/main.rs`; the scene
  editor is `cargo run --bin editor -- scenes/Village_Entrance.scene`
  (a free camera, the plate as geometry, the walk mesh drawn; F5 or
  just re-exporting the blend reloads it — bevy's own file watcher is
  not enabled, so the editor polls the file's write time). What both
  must agree on lives in `src/lib.rs`: the scene format, the walk mesh,
  the assets root, `depth_card_mesh`, and `scene_merge`. The game
  re-exports those with `pub use wakeful::{…}` so `crate::scene::…`
  keeps resolving; the old in-game egui editor is gone, and with it the
  `bevy_egui` dependency.
- Scene files have two authors and the exporter is only one of them.
  `tools/export_scenes.sh <blend>` is the whole export: Blender writes
  the plate, the depth map and `assets/scenes/<name>.export` (gitignored),
  then `cargo run --bin scene-merge` folds that half into `<name>.scene`,
  keeping the `actors`, `teleporters` and `script` the editor and
  hand-written scenes own (`ExportedScene` in `src/scene_merge.rs` is the
  exporter's half; a stray `actors` in an export is dropped, not merged).
  Consequence: `.scene` files are now generated, so **RON comments in
  them do not survive an export** — say what a scene needs said elsewhere.
- Bevy systems live in `src/systems/<concern>.rs` (e.g. `camera.rs`,
  `debug_draw.rs`); `main.rs` only wires plugins, schedules, and the shared
  components/resources the systems operate on. Self-contained feature modules
  (e.g. the editor) may keep their own systems internally.
- Rendering uses an offscreen pipeline (`src/screen.rs`): the game renders to
  a 320x240 texture, which a present camera integer-upscales with black bars
  — full retro pixelation for 2D and 3D alike.
- Movement runs on a fixed 60hz `FixedUpdate` schedule; the movement math in
  `movement.rs` is ECS-free and unit tested.
- Walkable ground is a triangle mesh, not a cell grid (`src/walkmesh.rs`,
  ECS-free and unit tested like `movement.rs`). A scene carries it as
  `walk_mesh: Option<WalkMesh>` — vertices plus triangle indices, exported
  by `tools/generate_scene.py` from the mesh objects inside the scene's
  `Cameras` sub-collection (read through the depsgraph so modifiers apply,
  welded at a millimeter). Characters FOLLOW its height
  (`walkmesh::ground_height`), so slopes carry them; `WalkableGrid` is gone
  and a scene without a mesh bounds nothing. Actors are constrained by
  default and opt out per actor with `constrained: false`.
- Note for anyone running `cargo fmt`: this branch is NOT rustfmt-clean
  (123 pre-existing diffs), and there is no CI. Format the file you are
  working in; never `cargo fmt --all` on top of a feature change.
- Art direction: FF7-style — 3D characters over pre-rendered backgrounds.
  The ground plane is a placeholder until real background art exists.
- The debug layer (`src/debug_shot.rs` + `src/debug_server.rs`, both
  `cfg(debug_assertions)`): debug builds serve an MCP server on
  `127.0.0.1:8399/mcp` (see `.opencode/skill/wakeful-debug`) whose
  tools screenshot the game, inject input, dump state, and run rhai
  against the live world — agent-driven verification without
  recompiles. Commands flow through a queue drained at the head of
  the fixed tick; screenshots land in `.debug/shots/`. Launching with
  `--console` adds an interactive rhai REPL on stdin.
- `src/bin/snapshot_mac_os.rs` was removed — the debug shot layer replaced
  it.
