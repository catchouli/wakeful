//! The camera pan: a scene whose background plate is bigger than the
//! game's 320x240 view shows a window of it that follows the player,
//! clamping at the plate's edges (the player walks to the edge; the
//! window just stops).
//!
//! The window is a `SubCameraView` on the scene camera: a pure crop of
//! the full plate view, so nothing about the world, the actors, or the
//! depth card changes as it slides — apply_scene set the full view's fov
//! to the plate's bake fov, and the card *is* the plate.
