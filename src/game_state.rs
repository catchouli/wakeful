//! The game's top-level state: playing a scene, transitioning between
//! contexts (a battle starting, a battle ending — scene warps later),
//! or fighting a battle.
//!
//! Systems declare which state they belong to with `run_if(in_state(..))`
//! — the world freezes around a transition and a battle without any
//! ad-hoc checks — and each module suspends and restores its own
//! entities at the covered point of a transition, behind an opaque
//! screen. Battle.rs, scene.rs, and transition.rs share this vocabulary
//! and nothing else.
